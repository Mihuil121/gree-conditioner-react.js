First version of the Gree air conditioner control app

No API usage

I created the first version of the Gree air conditioner control app, which could turn it on and off, and set the operating time. The app was written in React using regular functions.

However, when working with the Gree air conditioner API, I encountered a problem. The API did not return the correct operating time for the air conditioner. As a result, I had to make changes to the app's code to fix this problem.

As a result of working on the project, I learned how to use regular functions for React.

In the future, I plan to release a second version of the app with improved mobile layout, fixed operating time for the air conditioner, and API usage for the Gree air conditioner.

However, in the first version of the app, I did not use the API. Instead, I used static data for the operating time of the air conditioner.
